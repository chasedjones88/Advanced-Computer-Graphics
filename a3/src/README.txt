////////////
// Objects

Object and texture I created was a d8, or an 8 sided polyhedron. I made the texture d8 texture in GIMP.

Monkey object was made in blender as a stock object with 4 layers of subdivision.

////////////
// Textures

Stone texture was from this website with free personal and commercial use.

Skybox Texture was from the program folder on Canvas.

I also created the checkered texture in GIMP.

///////////
// Notes

I also implemented a 'roll' function to roll left and right, bound to NUMPAD1 and NUMPAD3 respectively.
The Reset button at the top of the layout will reset the camera to the starting orientation with pos (20, 20, 20) and (-35, 45, 0) rotation.
