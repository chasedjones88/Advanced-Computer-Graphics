// Textures

Object and texture I created was a d8, or an 8 sided polyhedron. I made the texture d8 texture in GIMP.

Other textures I used of celestial bodies were from this website which offers these textures under Creative Commons, and may be used for any purpose, even commercial.

I also created the checkered texture in GIMP.

// Notes

I also implemented a 'roll' function to roll left and right, bound to NUMPAD1 and NUMPAD3 respectively.
The Reset button at the top of the layout will reset the camera to the starting orientation with pos (20, 20, 20) and (-35, 45, 0) rotation.
